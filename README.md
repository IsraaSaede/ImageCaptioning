## Project Overview
The Image Captioning model is an advanced system that generates descriptive captions for images. Leveraging a deep learning architecture combining a pre-trained InceptionV3 CNN for feature extraction and Transformer layers for sequence generation, the Image Captioning model accurately captures the context of images to produce relevant and meaningful captions.

## Key Features
### Image Captioning:
- Deep Learning Model: Utilizes a combination of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) and Transformer-based architectures to generate detailed and context-aware captions for images.
- High Accuracy: Achieves high accuracy in generating relevant captions that capture the essence of the image content.

### Pre-trained InceptionV3 Model:
- Feature Extraction: Uses the InceptionV3 model pre-trained on ImageNet for robust feature extraction from images, ensuring high-quality inputs for caption generation.

### Transformer-based Sequence Generation:
- Encoder-Decoder Architecture: Incorporates Transformer layers for both encoding image features and generating captions, leveraging the power of attention mechanisms to handle complex language structures.
